Crumbs Theme
======

Crumbs is a temporary holding page to be used as a last resort for when a client has repeatedly ignored or refused to pay the invoices for their web services.

Crumbs is a free responsive WordPress theme that can be activated or deactivated without detrimental effect to the theme the client should be paying for.

How to use Crumbs for WordPress
======

1. Firstly, you need to have WP Admin clearance to use Crumbs, if so download the Crumbs theme and upload it onto your client’s WordPress theme folder - do not activate it yet.
                                                                                                                                                       
2. If you have other Admin users who could potentially turn off the Crumbs Theme before payment, go to Users > [Select other users] > Edit and change their role to Author and save.

3. With the current theme still active, go to WordPress > Appearance > Widgets, make a note of the current widgets and their positions, and then drag them into the ‘Inactive Widgets’ area. This will retain their settings for when you put the theme live again later after payment.

4. Go to Appearance > Themes and activate Crumbs.

5. Email your client and politely let them know that Crumbs will remain active until payment is cleared.
